Garage App - JSON CRUD using Django

In order to test the server application, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. First we have to make some test cases in the tests.py file present in my project's location in Garage2/GarageApp/ which I have already done in my project.

2. You may open my tests.py file to see that I have created test cases for GET, POST, PUT, UPDATE AND DELETE functions, for cars, trucks and boats that is in total there are about 12 test cases for this project.

3. In order to successfully run these tests go to command line (in pycharm while the project is opened) and type- python manage.py test

4. The above command will run all the tests. 

5. Alternatively, you may use Postman in order to test my project.


If you want to run my project on the web browser follow these steps:

1. First open the project (you may use pycharm), type the following command line:python manage.py runserver

2. Open your web browser and in the URL bar type: localhost:8000
